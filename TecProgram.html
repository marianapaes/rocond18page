                <p><b class="bluetext">ROCOND'18 Plenary Talk: Easy, hard or convex?: the role of sparsity and structure in robust control and identification.</b></p>
                <p><b>Speaker:</b><i>Mario Sznaier</i>, College of Engineering, Northeastern University, USA</p>
                <p><b>Abstract:</b>Arguably, one of the hardest challenges faced now by the systems community stems from the exponential explosion in the availability of data, fueled by recent advances in sensing and actuation capabilities. Simply stated, classical techniques are ill equipped to handle very large volumes of (heterogeneous) data, due to poor scaling properties, and to impose the structural constraints required to implement ubiquitous sensing and control.  For example, the powerful Linear Matrix Inequality framework developed in the past 20 years and associated semidefinite program based methods have proven very successful in providing global solutions to many control and identification problems. However, in may cases these methods break down when considering problems involving just a few hundred data points. On the other hand, several in-principle non-convex problems (e.g identification and robust control of classes of switched systems) can be efficiently solved in cases involving large amounts of data. Thus the traditional convex/non-convex dichotomy may fail to completely capture the intrinsic difficulty of some problems.

  The goal of this talk is to explore how  this “curse of dimensionality”  can be potentially overcome by exploiting the twin “blessings” of self-similarity  (high degree of spatio-temporal correlation in the data) and inherent underlying sparsity, and to answer the question of  "what is Big Data in systems theory?".   While these ideas have already been recently used in machine learning (for instance in the context of dimensionality reduction and variable selection),  they have hitherto not been fully exploited in systems theory.  By appealing to a  deep connection to semi-algebraic optimization, rank minimization and matrix completion we will show that, in the context of systems theory, the limiting factor is given by the ``memory" of the system  rather than the size of the data itself, and discuss the implications of this fact.  These concepts will be illustrated by examining  examples of  "easy" and "hard" problems, including  identification and control of hybrid systems and (in)validation of switched models. We will conclude the talk by exploring the connection between hybrid systems identification, information extraction, and machine learning, and point out to new research directions in systems theory and in machine learning motivated by these problems. </p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Bellman's Principle of Optimality is the main tool to formulate sampled-
  			  data control design problems as convex programming ones for LTI and Markov Jump
  			  Linear Systems. Stability and performance conditions are determined and expressed
  			  through differential linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs). This important fact opens
  			  the possibility to deal with plant parameters uncertainty in convex domains. Optimal
  			  control and guaranteed cost control problems in the context of H2 and H &infin;  norms are
  			  considered. Design problems to be numerically solved are handled upon constraints
  			  are converted to LMIs. The limit case characterized by arbitrarily small sampling
  			  period is discussed. Examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

                  <p><b>Speaker:</b> <i>Karl H. Johansson,</i> KTH Royal Institute of Technology

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Freight transportation on roads is of utmost importance for our society. It accounts for a significant amount of all energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this talk, we will discuss the potential future of road goods transportation and how it can be made more robust and efficient, from the automation of individual long-haulage trucks to the optimisation of fleet management and logistics. Such an integrated cyber-physical transportation system benefits from having trucks travelling together in vehicle platoons.  From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks travelling close together can save more than 10% of their fuel consumption. In addition, by automating the driving, it is possible to change driver regulations and thereby increase the efficiency even more. Control and optimization problems on various level of this transportation system will be presented. It will be argued that a system architecture utilising vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication enable robust and safe control of individual trucks as well as optimised vehicle fleet collaborations and new market opportunities. Extensive experiments done on European highways will illustrate system performance and safety requirements. The presentation will be based on joint work over the last ten years with collaborators at KTH and at the truck manufacturer Scania. </p>

                      <p><b>Speaker:</b><i>Andr&eacute;s Marcos</i> University of Bristol (UK) </p>


                       
                      <p> <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk several aerospace industrial study cases are used to illustrate the validity of robust modeling, analysis and control techniques. The results showcase the fundamental importance of the linear fractional transformation (LFT) and linear parameter varying (LPV) robust modeling paradigms. These models enable the application of robust analyses methods (e.g. structured singular value and integral quadratic constraints) that complement, and serve as a bridge for, the classical linear and nonlinear simulation analyses used by industry. Furthermore, their concurrent use with robust control synthesis approaches (from structured H-infinity to LPV) allows to formalize a modeling, analysis and design framework that facilitates the inherently difficult performance versus robustness trade-off across wide system variations. As a conclusion of the talk it is shown that such a framework using LPV control design is (at least for the case of launcher systems in atmospheric phase) more methodological, capable and transparent than the more advanced and complex adaptive approaches currently in favour in academia and industry. </p>

                      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Here we present a methodology to obtain low order LPV models focused on controller design for Diabetes Mellitus type 1, also called the Artificial Pancreas. The data to compute these models comes from the distributed version of the well-known UVa/Padova simulator. The LPV dynamics take into account the time-varying and nonlinear nature of the problem, as well as the subcutaneous-intravenous delays. The model is tuned to each patient by means of his/her clinical information. The resulting dynamics are presented as a delayed affine LPV model, which makes it amenable to LPV design methods. The efficiency of this model is measured in terms of quadratic errors and by the $\nu$-gap metric. An enhancement of these LPV models, which includes the intra-patient variations, is also discussed. An application example is presented, describing the first Latin America clinical trial, which used the ARG control algorithm.</p>
